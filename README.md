The data was more than 100,000 happy moments crowd-sourced via Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk. Each worker is given the following task: What made you happy today? Reflect on the past 24 hours, and recall three actual events that happened to you that made you happy. Write down your happy moment in a complete sentence. (Write three such moments.)

The goal of the corpus is to advance the understanding of the causes of happiness through text-based reflection. Based on the happy moment statement you have to predict the category of happiness, i.e. the source of happiness which is typically either of the following: 'bonding', 'achievement', 'affection', 'leisure', 'enjoy_the_moment', 'nature', 'exercise'.
